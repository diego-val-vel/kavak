## Environment Variables

This repository includes a `.env` file **only for reviewer convenience** to allow running the project without additional configuration.
We acknowledge this is **not a best practice**. In production environments, environment variables must never be committed to version control and should be managed securely.

## Branching Policy

This repository uses a **single branch**: `main`.
All work is committed directly to `main` to simplify the review process for this challenge.
